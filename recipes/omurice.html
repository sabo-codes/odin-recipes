        <li>2 Tbsp milk (divided)</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <h2>Ketchup Fried Rice</h2>
        <li>Before You Start: Day-old rice works best for fried rice. Bring the refrigerated day-old rice or frozen rice to room temperature. If you don‘t have day-old rice, you can cook 1 rice cooker cup (¾ US cup, 180 ml) of short-grain rice; spread out the hot rice on a baking sheet to cool completely. See how to cook Japanese rice with a rice cooker, pot over the stove, Instant Pot, or donabe.</li>
        <li>Gather all the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Mince ½ onion finely into ⅛-inch (3-mm) pieces.</li>
        <li>Dice 1 boneless, skinless chicken thigh into ½-inch (1.3-cm) pieces.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil in a large frying pan over medium heat and sauté the onions until tender.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken and cook until it's no longer pink.</li>
        <li>Add ½ cup frozen mixed vegetables (defrosted) and season with ⅛ tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt and ⅛ tsp freshly ground black pepper.</li>
        <li>Add 2 servings cooked Japanese short-grain rice. Use a cutting motion with your spatula to break the clumps into small pieces.</li>
        <li>Add 1 Tbsp ketchup and 1 tsp soy sauce and stir to combine. Transfer the fried rice to a plate and wash the pan.</li>
        <li>Serve with noodles (jjajangmyeon) or steamed rice (jjajangbap).</li>

        <h2>Omurice</h2>
        <li>We‘ll make the omurice one at a time. Whisk 1 egg and 1 Tbsp milk in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 Tbsp oil in the pan over medium-high heat. Distribute the oil to make sure the surface of the pan is coated well.</li>
        <li>When the pan is hot, pour in the egg mixture and tilt the pan to coat the entire surface with the egg. Cook the egg until the bottom has set but the top is still soft. Lower the heat to medium low.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle 3 Tbsp shredded cheese on top, then add 1 serving of ketchup fried rice across the middle of the omelette.</li>
        <li>Use the spatula to fold both sides of the omelette over the middle to cover the fried rice. Carefully move the omurice to the edge of the pan.</li>
        <li>Holding a plate in one hand and the pan in the other, flip the pan to transfer the omurice, seam side down, onto the plate.</li>
        <li>While it’s still hot, cover the omurice with a paper towel and form it with your hands into an elongated oval shape (similar to an American football or rugby ball). Repeat to make the next omurice.</li>
        <li>Drizzle additional ketchup in a zigzag pattern on top for decoration and enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
